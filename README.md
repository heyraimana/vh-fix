# vh-fix
An easy to use library that makes vh units work in iOS Chrome.

vh-fix makes elements with vh units render more consistently in iOS Chrome. It's painless, tiny, and aims to be an easy choice for normalizing vh behavior. You can also [read more about how and why I built vh-fix](https://medium.com/@raimanadh/how-and-why-i-built-vh-fix-2bc0288eb5af).

## Contributing
vh-fix aims to be painless, weightless, and easy to use. Currently the goals are to improve it upon those three metrics. In practice, this means removing the need for adding a class name to each vh element, keeping the file size tiny, improving upon its design, adding testing, and preparing it as a npm package. If you have any suggestions for these points or others, I would love to work with you!
